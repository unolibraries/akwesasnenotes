Mining and analyzing Akwesasne Notes data

Plain text files are from OCRed newspaper pages. These pages can be found in the [American Indian Digital History Project](http://aidhp.com).

Structured data is extracted from the newspapers and found in the `data` folder. 

The R files contain code to parse the data. In some cases, I deleted information before parsing (tables, etc.).
